Hello and welcome to my 2D Tic Tac Toe game!

To play this game, clone the repository and cd into the cloned folder, then run it using the following command: ruby tic_tac_2d.rb.

To play a human, press 'h' on startup. CPU functionality will be added in the future. Click on the square you would like to select until either X or O gets three in a row. Press 'r' to restart the game.

Have fun!
